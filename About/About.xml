Improves the safe temperature mechanic by forcing pawns to immediately drop what they're doing upon reaching serious temperature to go wait in a safe temperature area. Also forces them to stay in the safe temperature area until they are no longer shivering/initial heatstroke. They're also smart about it and won't interrupt their work if they're already on their way to the closest safe temperature. Includes options to tweak these behaviors.

=== Updates ===
10/18/2024: Add settings for various pawn behaviors
04/29/2024: Update to 1.5, fix errors/warnings in log, prevent pawns from waiting in doorways, and allow pawns to use smarter, less all-or-nothing logic when selecting an area to seek temperature safety
08/24/2023: Restricts safe temperature behavior to colonists only
07/18/2023: Allows pawns to perform work in safe temperature zones, allows player to manually assign jobs inside or outside of safe temperature zones.
