Improves the safe temperature mechanic by forcing pawns to immediately drop what they're doing upon reaching serious temperature to go wait in a safe temperature area. Also forces them to stay in the safe temperature area until they are no longer shivering/initial heatstroke.

=== Updates ===
03/20/2024: Update to 1.5
08/24/2023: Restricts safe temperature behavior to colonists only
07/18/2023: Allows pawns to perform work in safe temperature zones, allows player to manually assign jobs inside or outside of safe temperature zones.
07/14/2023: Allows player control while pawn is drafted.
